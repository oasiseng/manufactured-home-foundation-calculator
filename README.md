A simple, web-based tool to estimate foundation sizes, piers, tie-down spacing, and material costs for manufactured home foundations based on the HUD Permanent Foundations Guide for Manufactured Housing (PFGMH, HUD 7584). This calculator helps users get quick HUD-compliant estimates incorporating factors like soil bearing capacity, wind zones, and seismic adjustments.

**Note:** This is an estimation tool for educational purposes. Always consult a licensed engineer for actual designs and certifications. Costs are rough material estimates; labor and regional variations are not included.
